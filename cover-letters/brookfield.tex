Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{6pt}

I'm applying for the Performance and Attribution Analyst position in the Public Securities Group. The combination of multi-factor attribution analysis, performance measurement, and client-facing reporting is well-suited to my background.

\vspace{6pt}

I should be upfront: my background is in academia, not industry. But factor-based return attribution is the core of what I research. My published and ongoing work focuses on decomposing equity returns into risk premia components, building and testing factor models, and understanding what drives portfolio performance---across equities, derivatives, and multi-asset contexts. I've worked extensively with large-scale financial datasets, built reproducible analytical pipelines, and explained technical results to both academic and practitioner audiences. I code daily, have deep familiarity with performance measurement methodology, and I'm working through the CFA program (Level II passed).

\vspace{6pt}

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my background could contribute to the Public Securities Group's performance and attribution work.

\vspace{12pt}

Sincerely,

\vspace{24pt}

Tyler Beason
