Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{6pt}

I'm applying for the Senior Associate position on the Derivatives Pricing \& Securities team. Valuation work that requires both derivatives expertise and analytical rigor is a natural fit for my background.

\vspace{6pt}

I should be upfront: my background is in academia, not industry. But my published and ongoing research focuses on derivatives valuation---extracting information from options surfaces, modeling variance risk premia, and decomposing equity risk premia under uncertainty. That work has required building and stress-testing pricing models against large-scale financial data, exactly the kind of scrutiny that pricing operations demands. I code daily, have deep familiarity with the quantitative foundations behind derivatives products and market conventions, and I'm working through the CFA program (Level II passed).

\vspace{6pt}

I'm looking to transition into a role where the valuation skills I've built in a research context are applied to real portfolios with real stakes. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my background could contribute to Barings' pricing operations.

\vspace{12pt}

Sincerely,

\vspace{24pt}

Tyler Beason
