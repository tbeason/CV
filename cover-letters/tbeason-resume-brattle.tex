% Experience
\section{Experience}
\textbf{Virginia Tech} \hfill 2021--Present \\
\textit{Assistant Professor of Finance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Led quantitative research across equity risk premia, alpha signals/factor models, tail risk, and derivatives analytics; published in the \textit{Journal of Political Economy}
\item Built reproducible research pipelines using CRSP/Compustat, TAQ (tick-level), and full-surface options data; implemented model optimization, estimation, backtesting, and Monte Carlo simulation frameworks
\item Developed and validated empirical analytics spanning risk-neutral information extraction from option surfaces, execution-quality diagnostics, and market-impact measurement using high-frequency data
\item Presented results to technical audiences (NBER; Federal Reserve System) and practitioner venues; consistently recognized for clear communication of quantitative concepts (strong teaching evaluations)
\end{itemize}
