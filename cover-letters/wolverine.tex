Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{6pt}

I'm applying for the Quantitative Analyst position on the relative value arbitrage strategy teams. Partnering with portfolio managers to develop and improve trading strategies through quantitative research is exactly the kind of work I want to do.

\vspace{6pt}

My background is in academic finance rather than industry, but the analytical core transfers directly. My published and ongoing research focuses on equity risk premia, factor models, and derivatives valuation---identifying mispricings, understanding relative value across securities, and testing those ideas against large-scale financial data. I code daily, build data pipelines and simulation frameworks, and have a strong foundation in probability, statistics, and econometrics. I'm comfortable working across asset classes and have deep experience with noisy, complex datasets.

\vspace{6pt}

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my research background could contribute to WAM's quantitative strategies.

\vspace{12pt}

Sincerely,

\vspace{24pt}

Tyler Beason
