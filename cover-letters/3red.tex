Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{6pt}

I'm applying for the Quant position based in Chicago. Researching and testing alphas at a prop firm that takes quantitative rigor seriously is exactly the kind of work I want to do.

\vspace{6pt}

My background is in academic finance rather than industry, but the substance of my research maps directly to this role. I study alpha signals, factor models, and equity risk premia---identifying what predicts returns and what doesn't, then testing those ideas against large-scale financial data. My work on algorithmic execution quality using high-frequency data gives me a concrete understanding of how trading strategies interact with market microstructure. I code daily, build simulation and backtesting frameworks, and have a strong mathematical foundation in estimation, optimization, and time-series analysis.

\vspace{6pt}

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my research background could contribute to 3Red's trading strategies.

\vspace{12pt}

Sincerely,

\vspace{24pt}

Tyler Beason
